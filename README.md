Here we will push solves of various kind of C programming problems
With comments on difficult lines to make it understandable to all!
Try to contribute.
Please don't edit existing file if you want to do that do locally don't commit.
If you want to solve a new problem please do that in a new .c file.
File name should be similar to the problems you are solving.
Thanks!

1.Given a sequence of 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 9, 17, …, starting from item 4, each item is the sum of the first three items before it. Find the last 4 digits of item 20211109.

2.There are 5 numbers：0， 1， 2， 3， 4. How many different, non-repeating three-digit numbers can you make up? 

3. There are 5 numbers：0， 1， 2， 2， 3. How many different, non-repeating three-digit numbers can you make up? 

4.Write a program, input two arrays A and B, output common elements of the two arrays (duplicate elements are outputted only once) . For example, type A = 123435, and B = 2376. The output is: 23.


6. A so called "monkey and peach problem"is described as follows: A little monkey culled some peaches. On the first day he ate half plus one of his peaches. On the second day he ate half plus one of the rest peaches, and so forth on later days. On the tenth day, only one peach was left. How many peaches did he have at the beginning? Write a function fun to solve that problem and have a driver to call it. 

7. Write a function to determine the relationship of a point (x, y) and a circle x2+y2=-4.If the point is on the circle, the return value will be 0; if the point is inside the circle the return value will be -1, and if the point is outside the circle the return value is 1. Have the function be called in a main function.


8. Write a program that outputs the following phalanx.
